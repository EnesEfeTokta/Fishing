## Success Calculations üåü
The achievement calculation algorithm is based on two main factors: the time it takes the player to complete the level and the value of points and money defined for each fish. Each fish has a predefined fixed value of points (P) and money (M). These values vary depending on how long it takes the player to complete the level. The calculation time is divided into four parts based on the level duration (S) and the earning rates are determined accordingly.
Bu hesaplama modelinin matematiksel tanƒ±mƒ± a≈üaƒüƒ±daki gibidir:

- **S:** Level duration
- **T:** Time completed by the player
- **P:** Fixed point value awarded per fish
- **M:** Fixed monetary value per fish

**Earnings Ratios:**

1. **T ‚â§ S/4:** Full P & M is earned.
2. **S/4 < T ‚â§ S/2:** Half of P & M is awarded (P/2 & M/2).
3. **S/2 < T ‚â§ 3S/4:** A quarter of P & M is awarded (P/4 & M/4).
4. **T > 3S/4:** a quarter of P and a constant quarter of M (P/4 & M/4).

**Total Earned Points & Money:**

Total earned points and money are calculated and totaled for each fish according to the above rules.

This algorithm provides a flexible rewarding based on the time completed by the player and allows to measure the level of success directly based on the player's performance.

## Marketing & Promotion Strategies üñäÔ∏è
### Target Audience Analysis
The needs of the target audience were identified through surveys and Q&A sessions conducted with a group of participants. These criteria were considered during the game's development process and played an important role in shaping the game.
### Social Media and Community
Gameplay videos will be shared on LinkedIn and TikTok. This process will only last for three months after the game is released. After three months, the posts and support will end.
### Improvements Based on User Feedback
Users will be able to provide feedback via **Email**, **LinkedIn**, and **GitHub Issues**. This feedback will contribute to the improvement of both the game itself and the development process.

üö® Since the project does not have a long-term goal, feedback will only be accepted for five months after the game is released. However, since the project is open-source, it will be possible to provide feedback through **GitHub Issues** for a long time. Although full support will not be provided by the project owner, other volunteer developers contributing to the project may respond to this feedback and take necessary actions.
